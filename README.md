# Ticket Sales Analysis
Analyzing ticket sales data using SQL

## Introduction
In this SQL project, I embarked on an engaging exploration of ticket sales data, aiming to gain valuable insights through meticulous event analysis, seller analysis, and buyer analysis. Leveraging my proficient querying skills, I delved deep into the dataset to discover insights and key metrics that shed light on the dynamic world of ticket sales.

## Dataset
For this project, I harnessed the wealth of data available from Datacamp's Redshift database, establishing a virtual workspace that served as a gateway to unlock the treasure trove of insights hidden within. Within this dataset, I meticulously examined seven key tables: 'category,' 'event,' 'date,' 'sales,' 'venue,' 'users,' and 'listing.' Each of these tables held a distinct piece of the puzzle, offering critical information necessary for a comprehensive analysis.

## Goal
The primary objective of this project was to harness the power of SQL in a real-world context by formulating and addressing pertinent business questions. It provided a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical SQL knowledge and its practical application, enabling me to delve deep into the dataset and extract actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making. Through this hands-on experience, I not only honed my SQL skills but also gained a profound understanding of how data analysis can drive informed business decisions, making this project a valuable showcase of both technical proficiency and practical problem-solving acumen.
